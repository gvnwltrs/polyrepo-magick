# PolyrepoMagick

## Why
Are you tired of managing a gigantic monotlithic repo? Do you hate managing multi or polyrepos whilst not knowing what the hell is going in the other repos? Do really like using submodules? If you answered yes to the first two and no to the last, then come and join me on a journey towards a loosely coupled modular repo management system that will keep you out of dependency hell and in dependency heaven! 

## Stage 1 
The plan. Set up this repo as a template that can be forked and used for any project. Set up a script or some form of automation here to begin pulling in other repos that exist or will exist so that they can live on a developers machine so they can be worked on selectively. So if this repo is your "core" repo to manage the others lets say, you would use the [tool] to pull those repos onto your machine in the location you wish (outside of the "core -- this repo" on your local machine). It will go something like this (by default) --- WIP
